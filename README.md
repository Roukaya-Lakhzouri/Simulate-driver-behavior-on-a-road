# Project: Road Safety and Traffic Flow Modeling

This project contains two main models, each designed to address specific aspects of road safety and traffic flow.

### Model 1: Unsafe Lane Change Analysis
Unsafe and dangerous lane changes are a persistent threat to road safety. This model aims to address this issue by utilizing simulation techniques to assess the potential risks and benefits of these lane changes. Specifically, it evaluates whether dangerous lane changes contribute to time savings for drivers or simply increase road hazards. By simulating such scenarios, we aim to provide data-driven insights into the actual impact of risky driving behaviors.

### Model 2: Traffic Flow Baseline and Modified Analysis
The objective of the second model is twofold:
1. **Baseline Traffic Flow Model**: First, a baseline model is constructed to represent traffic flow prior to any road modifications. This model serves as a reference, helping us accurately gauge the effects of structural adjustments.
2. **Updated Traffic Flow Model**: Next, an updated model is developed that incorporates recent changes to the roadâ€™s design. By comparing the baseline and updated models, we can assess how the modifications have influenced traffic behavior.

Through these two models, this project aims to contribute valuable insights into road safety improvements and the optimization of traffic flow based on simulated data.
